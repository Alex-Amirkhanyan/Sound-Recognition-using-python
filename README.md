# How to use


This is a sound recognition program which uses machine learning algorithms to identify and distinguish different sounds. It has an accuracy rate of 85% when validating.

## Downloads

Before getting started, you'll need to download the necessary libraries and packages using the following [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install sklearn
pip install librosa
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Libraries description

1. Tensorflow (for model making and training)
2. sklearn (for splitting the data into trian,test,validation)
3. librosa (for loading and feature extraction of audio signals)
4. pandas (for reading csv file)
5. matplotlib (for plotting)


## Final steps

1. Download [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or type in your cmd/terminal ```pip install notebook```

2. And then run it by simply typing ```jupyter notebook```

3. Then you just need to open the file and run the sections one by one


That's it, some code sections may take quite some time to finish their processing but there is no need to worry about it
